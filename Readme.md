# Readme

## purpose
This is a practice exercise in implementing a binary tree.
It's purpose is to practice algorithms and data structures, and TDD in Java.

# To Use
This exercise uses JShell, which implements a read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) that is accessible through CLI. 

1) Navigate to 'Java-binary-tree/trees' directory

(compilations have to happen in order due to imports)

2) Compile Node 
>`$javac -d . Node.java`

3) Compile Tree
>`$javac -d . Tree.java`

4) Compile TreeTest
>`$javac -d . TreeTest.java`

4) To run from CLI:
>`$ java trees.TreeTest`
