# Readme

## purpose
This is a practice exercise in implementing a binary search tree.
It's purpose is to practice algorithms and data structures, and TDD in Java.

# To Use
This exercise uses JShell (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/jshell/introduction-jshell.htm#JSHEL-GUID-630F27C8-1195-4989-9F6B-2C51D46F52C8), which implements a read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) that is accessible through CLI

If accessing from the CLI, compile classes in the following order: node, node test, tree, tree test

It was tested using the intelliJ debugger to run JUnit tests
